# 🚀 POC is Ready!

Your Smartcat Resumable Uploader POC is now running with a local mock S3 server!

## 🔗 Access Points

- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:4000
- **Mock S3 Server**: http://localhost:9000

## ✅ What's Running

1. **Mock S3 Server** (Port 9000)
   - Simulates AWS S3 API
   - Stores files locally in `mock-s3/uploads/`
   - Supports multipart uploads and presigned URLs

2. **Backend Server** (Port 4000)
   - Handles upload sessions
   - Generates presigned URLs
   - Manages multipart upload lifecycle

3. **Frontend Application** (Port 5173)
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Multiple concurrent uploads
   - Auto-resume functionality
   - Toast notifications

## 🧪 Test the POC

1. **Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser**

2. **Test Single Upload**
   - Drag and drop a file or click "Browse Files"
   - Watch the progress, speed, and ETA
   - Try pause/resume functionality

3. **Test Multiple Concurrent Uploads**
   - Select multiple files at once
   - See them upload simultaneously (up to 3 at a time)
   - Each file has individual controls

4. **Test Resume Functionality**
   - Start uploading a large file
   - Close the browser tab mid-upload
   - Reopen http://localhost:5173
   - The upload will appear paused and can be resumed

5. **Test Cross-Tab Sync**
   - Open multiple tabs of http://localhost:5173
   - Start uploads in one tab
   - See progress update in all tabs

## 📁 Uploaded Files

Files are stored in: `mock-s3/uploads/smartcat/uploads/`

## 🛑 Stopping the POC

To stop all services:
```bash
# Find and kill the processes
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9  # Frontend
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9  # Backend
lsof -ti:9000 | xargs kill -9  # Mock S3
```

## 🔄 Restarting the POC

If you need to restart:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Mock S3
cd mock-s3 && npm start

# Terminal 2: Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

## 🎉 That's It!

Your POC is fully functional without needing AWS, Docker, or any external services!
